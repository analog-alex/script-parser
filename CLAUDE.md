# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Rust project called `script-parser` that appears to be in early development stages. The project uses Rust edition 2024 and currently contains only a basic "Hello, world!" implementation.

## Development Commands

### Building and Running
- `cargo build` - Build the project
- `cargo run` - Build and run the project
- `cargo check` - Check code without building
- `cargo clippy` - Run linting checks
- `cargo fmt` - Format code according to Rust standards

### Testing
- `cargo test` - Run all tests
- `cargo test <test_name>` - Run specific test

## Architecture

The project currently has a minimal structure:
- `src/main.rs` - Entry point with basic main function
- `Cargo.toml` - Project configuration with no dependencies yet

This appears to be a foundation for a script parsing tool, though the specific parsing logic and architecture are yet to be implemented.

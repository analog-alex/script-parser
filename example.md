## Script

[Living Room]

The lights are dim, casting long shadows across the room.

ALICE: I can't believe you're actually leaving.

BOB: I don't have a choice, Alice. The job in New York is too good to pass up.

(Alice turns away, looking out the window)

ALICE: What about us? What about everything we've built here?

N: The silence stretches between them, heavy with unspoken words.

BOB: We can make this work. Long distance relationships aren't impossible.

(Bob reaches for Alice's hand)

ALICE: Aren't they?
